In a world increasingly driven by software, the complexity behind the scenes often goes unnoticed. But for those of us who live and breathe development, we know that building, deploying, and maintaining software isn't always as smooth as it should be. It was this realization, borne out of our own experiences, that led to the creation of Skyhook.

## A Tale of Three Techies

Back when Nadav (Skyhook CEO) was at Google Cloud, he didn't think much about the tools he had at his disposal. Every day, he'd get to work, grab a coffee, and jump straight into writing code. What he didn't realize at the time was just how much of a luxury it was to have all of the infrastructure set up and working like clockwork. It wasn't until he started talking to friends at other companies that he saw just how different things could be.

Eyal (Skyhook CTO), who was leading architecture at OneZero Digital Bank and eToro, had a very different experience. He spent years trying to build something like what Nadav had at Google—a smooth, efficient devops process that didn't feel like a constant uphill battle. But even after years of effort, the job was far from done. It was a tough, sometimes frustrating process, piecing together tools and systems to create something that worked.

Meanwhile, Roy was at Armis, a cybersecurity company, dealing with the same challenges. As a developer turned platform PM, he knew firsthand how tough it was to build a reliable internal platform from the ground up. It took years, countless hours, and no small amount of frustration.

## The Realization

After countless conversations with companies of all shapes and sizes, we started to notice a pattern. Building an efficient developer platform wasn't just a challenge—it was a massive drain on time, resources, and morale. Usually as high as 10-20% of the engineering workforce, taking months and years to reach a stable state. We kept hearing the same thing over and over: "There has to be a better way."

That's when the idea for Skyhook really started to take shape. We weren't just looking to build another tool; we wanted to create a platform that would take the pain out of DevOps, something that would let developers focus on what they do best—writing code—without getting bogged down in the complexities of deployment and infrastructure.

## Enter Skyhook

Skyhook is the result of our collective experiences. We designed it to be the go-to solution for software teams struggling with deployment and development headaches.

Our guiding principles for building Skyhook are what differentiates us from every other solution out there:

* **Don't reinvent the wheel:** Instead of re-creating solutions for the 30+ DevOps categories of tools, we simply orchestrate the best tools for you. As if we were a set of additional DevOps/Platform engineers on your team.
* **Flexibility and Control:** Skyhook is installed on our customer's cloud, and all configurations are stored within our customer's code repository. Allowing full flexibility and control for our customers to make direct changes.
* **No Lock-in:** Retain full control with no dependencies on specific cloud providers or third-party tools, including us\!
* **Simplicity:** Allowing anyone to get started within minutes, not days, with our fully configured environment. Without having to be a DevOps expert.
* **Empower Developers:** Leverage a self-service platform that allows any developer to use it from day one.
* **Designed to Scale:** Our platform grows with your needs, from startup to enterprise.

At the end of the day, Skyhook is about making life easier for developers and DevOps engineers. We're here to help you get your job done without all the extra hassle. Give Skyhook a try, we think you'll like it.
