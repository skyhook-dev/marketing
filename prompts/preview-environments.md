# Asset Generation Prompts for Preview Environments Page

Use these prompts with midjourney, DALL-E 3, or similar high-quality AI image generators.

## General Style Guide
- **Background Color:** Warm Alabaster (#F7F7F5) or White (#FFFFFF). Ideally, generate on a solid white background for easy removal, or use the hex code if the model supports it.
- **Primary Colors:** Dark Grey/Black (#111111) for main elements, International Orange (#FF4F00) for accents/highlights.
- **Vibe:** Engineered, precise, premium, "Apple-like" but for developer tools. Clean lines, matte materials, soft global illumination. Avoid "cyberpunk" neon or dark mode aesthetics unless specified.

## Option 1: Hero Visualization - "The Perfect Clone"
**Placement:** Top of the page, below the main headline or as a background element.
**Concept:** Visualizing the idea that a "Preview Environment" is a perfect, isolated clone of the production environment.

**Prompt:**
> A high-quality 3D abstract visualization of a "preview environment". A central, larger geometric structure (representing Production) composed of polished white and dark grey interconnected cubes and spheres. From this main structure, a single strand of orange light gently arcs outwards to form a smaller, identical, isolated floating structure (the Preview Environment). The smaller structure is enclosed in a faint, protective glass bubble. Soft studio lighting, clean white background, minimal shadows, isometric or 3/4 view. High definition, Octane render style. --ar 16:9

## Option 2: Process Visualization - "Code to Live URL"
**Placement:** Replaces the "TerminalBlock" in the Introduction section.
**Concept:** Showing the transformation from a code branch (Git) to a live, accessible URL.

**Prompt:**
> An isometric 3D illustration of a modern DevOps workflow. On the left, a stylized "git branch" icon made of matte black metal. It passes through a sleek, translucent orange gateway (representing Skyhook). On the right, it emerges as a glowing, floating window or browser interface showing a "success" state. The flow is connected by a clean cable or pipe. The style is minimal, clean, and architectural. White background, soft ambient occlusion. --ar 4:3

## Option 3: Value Prop - "Focus / Zen"
**Placement:** "The work you skip" section (currently the CheckCircle card).
**Concept:** Developers working peacefully while the chaos of infrastructure is contained/abstracted away.

**Prompt:**
> Abstract concept art of "developer focus". In the foreground, a sharp, pristine floating code editor window or symbol (minimalist). In the background, slightly blurred and desaturated, is a complex, tangled machinery of pipes and gears (representing Kubernetes complexity), but it is contained behind a smooth, translucent frosted glass wall. The foreground is bright and peaceful; the background is complex but muted. The glass wall has a subtle orange rim. Photorealistic materials, depth of field. --ar 1:1

## Option 4: Abstract Icons - "Micro-interactions"
**Placement:** "How it works" grid (Pull Request, Deployed, Test).
**Concept:** Replacing the standard Lucide icons with small, high-fidelity 3D spot illustrations.

**Prompt (Pull Request):**
> A small, high-quality 3D icon of a "git pull request". Two parallel matte black lines, one branching off and merging back in, with the merge point highlighted in glowing orange. Floating on a white background. Minimalist, icon design. --ar 1:1

**Prompt (Deployed):**
> A small, high-quality 3D icon of a "deployed server". A sleek, white server box with a single green status light, resting on a small floating platform. Minimalist, icon design. --ar 1:1

**Prompt (Test/Merge):**
> A small, high-quality 3D icon of a "checklist". A floating glass clipboard with orange checkmarks. Minimalist, icon design. --ar 1:1
