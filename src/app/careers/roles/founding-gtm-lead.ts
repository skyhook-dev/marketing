    overview: `You'll be the first marketing/growth hire at Skyhook – a "Swiss army knife" who can move from high-level messaging to hands-on lead generation and follow-ups.

This role combines elements you'll see in growth marketing / demand generation / developer marketing / SDR roles at devtool companies: driving top-of-funnel pipeline, crafting messaging for developers/DevOps, and running scrappy outbound and inbound experiments.

If you enjoy figuring things out end-to-end – from "who exactly is our ICP?" all the way to "what copy will make this CTO/Dev/DevOps lead actually reply?" – you'll be a great fit.`,
