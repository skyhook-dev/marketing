# Build page

## Build with Skyhook

Take your code from repository to container image with unmatched speed and reliability. Leverage a Kubernetes-native pipeline that scales on demand, so every commit triggers a consistent build in an isolated environment. By automating builds, Skyhook ensures reproducible results and quick feedback for your developers. 

## How It Works

Connect Your Repo:   
Link your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to Skyhook.  Commits can automatically trigger the build pipeline.

Containerized Build Process:   
Skyhook ensures the process end-to-end: compile code, run tests, and package your application with consistency across environments.

Flexible Build Configuration:   
Use your own Dockerfile or use the Skyhook defaults. Customize environment variables and dependencies as needed, since Skyhook supports any language or framework that runs in a container.

Optimized Artifacts:   
The pipeline produces an OCI-compliant container image (and other artifacts if configured) ready for deployment. Built images can be pushed to your preferred registry or stored securely within the platform for the Deploy stage.

Feedback & Logs:   
Developers get immediate feedback. Real-time logs and notifications inform you of success or failure. If something goes wrong, detailed logs in the web UI or CLI make troubleshooting straightforward.

| Bulletproof CI:  The system can run multiple builds in parallel, auto-scaling build agents to meet your team’s demand. | Layer Caching:  Intelligent caching speeds up repeat builds by reusing unchanged layers (for example, skipping steps when dependencies haven’t changed). This dramatically cuts down build times for iterative development. | Security Scanning: (Optional) Integrate container scanning tools in the pipeline. Since builds are containerized, you can easily plug in vulnerability scanners or linters without modifying your base environment. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Multi-Language Support: Build applications in Node, Python, Java, Go, or any language. If it can run in a container, Skyhook can build it. No specialized or proprietary config required. | Configuration as Code: Define build steps and environment in a YAML config, or stick with convention over configuration for simple cases. Your build process lives alongside your code, versioned and auditable.  | Artifact Management: Store build outputs (images, binaries, reports) and track build history. Every build is tagged and timestamped, making it easy to trace which code went into which image. |

# Deploy page

Deploy with Skyhook

Release your applications in a fast, repeatable, and worry-free process. Skyhook takes container images from the Build stage and launches them onto your Kubernetes cluster with minimal configuration. By automating the heavy lifting of container orchestration, Skyhook enables your team to deploy more often and more confidently, becoming a high-performing DevOps teams.

How It Works

Select an Image:   
Choose the container image you want. Skyhook supports images from public or private registries, giving you full flexibility.

Define Deployment Settings:   
Specify how your application should run – number of replicas, CPU/memory limits, environment variables, and any required services (like load balancers or ingresses). 

One-Click or CI-triggered Deploy:   
Hit deploy in the dashboard or let Skyhook auto-deploy new images when they pass tests. Skyhook will create or update the Kubernetes Deployment and Service resources under the hood.

Rolling Updates:   
Skyhook updates your application using rolling updates by default. New pods come up before old ones are terminated, ensuring continuous service availability. If a new version fails health checks, the platform can halt or roll back the deployment automatically.

Access & Networking:   
Once running, your service is reachable via a stable endpoint. Skyhook can provision a DNS name and TLS certificate for public services, or restrict access for internal services. Configuration of port routing and network policies is handled seamlessly.

| Zero-Downtime Deployments: Uses Kubernetes rollout mechanisms to update applications without interrupting service. Updates are applied gradually, and only healthy pods receive traffic. | Declarative Configuration: Everything about your deployment (replicas, environment vars, configs) can be defined in declarative files. Skyhook can sync with Git so your deployments are version-controlled.  | Canary & Blue-Green Support:  Gradually shift traffic between old and new versions or run two versions in parallel for testing. While the default is rolling updates, advanced teams can implement canary or blue-green strategies using Skyhook’s CLI and Kubernetes labels. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Configurable Environments: Deploy to multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with the same process. You can promote a build through environments with one click, ensuring consistency from testing to production. | Integration Hooks:  Integrate with external CI/CD systems or pipelines. For example, use a GitHub Action or ArgoCD to trigger Skyhook deployments via API. Skyhook plays nicely with existing tools, so you’re not locked in. |  |

# Run page

Run with Skyhook  
Keep your applications healthy, performant, and secure once they’re deployed. Skyhook’s Kubernetes-native runtime ensures your containers are managed by battle-tested orchestration logic – from automatic restarts on failure to intelligent load balancing. Get the reliability and resilience of Kubernetes without the manual overhead.

How it works  
Kubernetes Orchestration:   
Skyhook creates Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Pods, Services, etc.) on the cluster. Kubernetes schedules your pods on available nodes, taking into account resource needs and optimizing binpacking.

Health Management:   
Each service can be configured with health checks (readiness and liveness probes). Skyhook will use these to let Kubernetes monitor the app’s health. If a container fails or becomes unresponsive, Kubernetes will mark it unhealthy and restart it or replace it automatically.

Scaling & Load Balancing:   
The platform distributes traffic across multiple instances of your service using Kubernetes Services or Ingress. You can also define autoscaling policies so the system adds or removes replicas based on demand.

Secure Separation:   
Each service runs in its own isolated environment, enforcing limits on CPU, memory, and network as you specified. Skyhook uses Kubernetes security best practices out of the box.

Continuous Monitoring:   
The runtime constantly collects metrics and status from your applications. Skyhook surfaces this information (like CPU usage, memory, restart counts) in the dashboard. This means you always know how your services are performing in real time.

| Self-Healing: If a container crashes or a node goes offline, the container will restart or reschedule on another node automatically. Your services recover from failures without human intervention. | Traffic Management:  Built-in load balancing ensures even distribution of requests. You can also implement advanced traffic control (like network policies or service mesh integration) since everything runs on standard Kubernetes – it’s compatible with Istio, Linkerd, or any tool you choose to add. | Secrets & ConfigMaps: Manage configuration and secrets securely. Skyhook lets you inject configs or sensitive values (API keys, credentials) via Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps, so they are available to the app at runtime but not baked into images or code. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| High Availability: Deployments can be spread across multiple nodes for resilience. Even during node maintenance or outages, your app instances remain available on other nodes.   | Resource Quotas & Limits: Prevent any single service from hogging resources. Set CPU and memory limits for each application; Kubernetes will enforce these at runtime. This means more predictable performance and no noisy-neighbor issues in multi-tenant clusters. | Rolling Maintenance: Perform cluster or application maintenance with minimal disruption. For example, update the base image or apply security patches using rolling updates. Skyhook coordinates these changes using Kubernetes controllers to avoid downtime. |

# Grow page

# Grow with Skyhook

Skyhook seamlessly scales your infrastructure and processes, so you can easily deal with more traffic, more services and more team members. Because Skyhook builds on Kubernetes, you can scale out across clusters or clouds confidently, knowing you won’t hit a proprietary ceiling or be stuck with vendor lock-in. 

How it works

Horizontal Scaling:   
Increase the replica count of your services with a simple configuration change or let the system handle it automatically. When load drops, Skyhook can scale back down.

Vertical Scaling:   
Adjust resources allotted to each application. Through Skyhook, you can bump up CPU or memory limits if a service needs more horsepower. Kubernetes will reallocate and ensure the app gets the needed resources, allowing you to fine-tune performance as usage grows.

Cluster Scaling & Multi-Cluster:   
If one cluster runs out of capacity, Skyhook adds more nodes (in cloud environments) or easily connecting additional clusters. The platform isn’t tied to one cloud – you can grow from a single cluster to multiple clusters across regions or providers as demand requires.

Service Discovery & Organization:   
As you add more microservices or modules, Skyhook helps organize them. Built-in service discovery means new services can find each other without custom wiring, even as the ecosystem grows complex.

| Automatic Pod Autoscaling: Leverage Kubernetes autoscaling to handle varying workloads. Define metrics (CPU, memory, or custom metrics) for your services, and Skyhook will automatically increase or decrease the number of pods to maintain performance.  | Multi-Region Deployments: Run your application closer to your users by deploying in multiple geographic regions. Skyhook supports configuring deployments in different regions and routing users accordingly, improving latency and redundancy for global scale. | Usage Analytics:  Track growth with built-in metrics on resource usage and application performance. Identify which services are nearing capacity or which times of day see peak traffic. These insights help with capacity planning and optimizing costs as you scale up. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Easy Cluster Expansion: When you need more compute power, add nodes to your cluster or attach a new cluster. Skyhook can deploy to multiple clusters from one control plane, allowing for hybrid or multi-cloud growth without changing your workflow. | Extensible Architecture: Skyhook is Kubernetes-native, meaning you can plug in custom operators, service meshes, or other CNCF ecosystem tools as you grow. The platform won’t box you in – it works with the broader cloud-native ecosystem. | Governance at Scale: Manage growing complexity with features like policy enforcement and auditing. Ensure that even as your team and infrastructure expand, everything stays compliant and under control through unified policies and logs. |

Observe page  
Observe with Skyhook  
Skyhook has built-in observability from day one, so you can monitor, trace, and troubleshoot your applications with ease. Through a single pane of glass, you get live logs, metrics, and health checks for all your services. Skyhook’s Kubernetes-native approach means it taps into standard observability tools without proprietary lock-in.

## How it works

Centralized Logging:   
Skyhook aggregates logs from all your application pods. View real-time streaming logs in the web console or CLI, filtered by service or severity. 

Metrics & Dashboards:   
The platform collects key metrics from Kubernetes and your containers (CPU, memory, requests, etc.). It presents these on intuitive dashboards so you can see at a glance how each service is performing. 

Alerts & Notifications:   
Define thresholds for critical metrics or error rates. Skyhook can integrate with alerting systems to notify your team when something’s amiss.

Audit and History: Every deployment, configuration change, and alert is recorded. Get an audit trail, so you can review who changed what and when. This is crucial for debugging complex issues or satisfying compliance requirements in regulated industries.

| Live Log Stream:  Access stdout/stderr logs from all pods in real time. Search and filter logs by keywords or service name. Developers can quickly locate error messages or exceptions without leaving the Skyhook interface. | Custom Metrics Support: Expose custom business or application metrics via endpoints (for instance, using Prometheus client libraries). Skyhook will scrape and display these metrics, letting you monitor application-level KPIs alongside system metrics. | Third-Party Integration: Skyhook’s use of standard protocols means you can pipe data to external systems. Send logs to an ELK stack, or feed metrics into Datadog – the data is yours, and integration is straightforward. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Built-in Monitoring Stack: Skyhook comes pre-integrated with a monitoring stack (built on popular open-source tools like Prometheus). It gathers container and node metrics automatically, so you have instant observability out-of-the-box. | Alert Rules Engine: Use a flexible rules engine to define alert conditions.  | Secure and Compliant: All telemetry data is transmitted securely and stored with best-practice retention policies. Role-based access ensures that sensitive logs (like user data in logs) are only visible to authorized personnel. These features help maintain compliance with standards like SOC 2 and GDPR when monitoring production systems. |

# AI Agent page

Notes to Self: (roni) August 7

In the product section, Skyhook has everything that Northflank has, except for \- databases, GPUs and managed clouds \- you can walk away any time, we don’t put ourselves at the center, we just help you manage

In the product section, again, maybe we do \-build+release+run together
